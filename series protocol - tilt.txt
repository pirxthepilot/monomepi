to the device:

TILTMODE, 1 byte
id = 12, bit 0 is on/off


from the device, when tiltmode=1:

TILT, 2 bytes
id = 13, bit 0 = x/y axis, byte 1 = val 

so:
208 127 = x axis, val 127 (centered)
209 50 = y axis, val 50 (tilted)




two-byte packets will come in for tilt:

208 x
209 y

after you send a single byte packet to turn on tiltmode:

193  (0xc1)

or turn it off:

192  (0xc2)
